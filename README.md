# Superforecasting Project: Bayesian Predictions on Global Events

## Project Summary
This project applies **Bayesian forecasting** to three real-world scenarios: U.S. inflation trends, geopolitical conflict risks, and media consumption forecasts. By decomposing each question into data-driven subcomponents and applying conditional probability, we simulate the mindset of expert superforecastersâ€”those who make consistently accurate, well-calibrated predictions.

## Forecasting Questions 

#### 1. Will U.S. inflation rise in 2024 compared to 2023?
#### 2. Will India and China enter a lethal military conflict by Dec 31, 2024?
#### 3. How many U.S. viewers will watch the Euro Cup 2024 Final live?

## Methodology & Tools

- **Bayesian Inference:** Updated priors with conditional sub-question weightings
- **Forecast Decomposition:** Broke each question into measurable factors
- **Historical Benchmarking:** Used real data to calibrate assumptions
- **Communication:** Synthesized findings into a presentation deck for stakeholders
